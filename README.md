Task 1
Design object model for given domain.
Please demonstrate usage of:
•	Classes (abstract classes - if applicable)
•	Interfaces
•	Inheritance
•	Polymorphism
•	Encapsulation
•	Collections framework.
Each class, method and variable should have meaningful name and purpose. You need to determine which classes are required to solve the task. Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense. Classes should be grouped into corresponding packages. Work with console should be minimized (only required data for input, output correspond the info in task). It is expected that you will choose certain domain from the list below, define classes hierarchy for that domain and implement it using OOP (inheritance or implementing interfaces). Each class should have methods and fields defined by you. Your program should create objects of different types in chosen domain and combine them into collection (use collections framework). Next, will be required to process data of that collection by certain rules.
Domain options (please choose and implement one of them).
1.	Flower shop. Define flowers hierarchy. Create several flower-objects. Create a bouquet and determine its price. 
 meets required criteria in the collection, impossible to delete an element etc. Leave your explanation in commented blocks of your exception class. Create at least 3 custom exceptions and use 5 built-in exceptions minimum.

Task 2
Enhance the scenarios implemented in task 2.1 – with reading from file / writing data to file using I/O Streams.
